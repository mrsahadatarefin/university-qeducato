Generative AI models such as OpenAIs DALL-E 2, Midjourney or Stable Diffusion produce impressive images of almost any style. The only input required is a text prompt that describes the desired result. The AI graphics tools speed up existing work processes, but can also create almost complete works of art.           The technology could therefore be an early example of AIs impact on the job market, says OpenAI founder Sam Altman. As the case of Jason Allen shows, whose AI artwork won an art competition, it is already causing trouble among artists and designers."
